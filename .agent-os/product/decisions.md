## 2025-07-25: Initial Product Architecture

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

PROJECT_map is designed as a zero-dependency Python tool that generates self-contained HTML reports with embedded visualizations. The tool prioritizes ease of use, AI-friendliness, and beautiful output over advanced features.

### Context

Many file system visualization tools require complex installations, produce plain text output, or generate outputs that require additional software to view. There was a need for a simple, beautiful, and powerful tool that works anywhere Python is installed.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Node.js with npm packages**
   - Pros: Rich ecosystem, modern tooling, easier web development
   - Cons: Requires Node installation, dependency management, build process

2. **Python with visualization libraries**
   - Pros: Powerful visualization options (matplotlib, plotly)
   - Cons: Heavy dependencies, installation complexity, version conflicts

3. **Go compiled binary**
   - Pros: Single binary, fast execution, no runtime needed
   - Cons: Harder to modify, less AI-friendly, limited visualization options

### Rationale

The zero-dependency Python approach was chosen because:
- Universal compatibility (Python standard library only)
- AI agents can easily read and modify Python code
- Self-contained HTML output works in any browser
- No installation or dependency management required
- Clear, readable code structure

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Extremely easy to deploy and use
- No dependency conflicts or version issues
- AI agents can understand and modify easily
- Outputs are completely self-contained

**Negative:**
- More code required for visualizations (can't use libraries)
- Limited to browser-based output format
- Performance might be slower than compiled solutions

## 2025-07-25: AI-First Code Design

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, AI Agents

### Decision

All code includes explicit AI-friendly markers (PURPOSE tags, AI_EDIT_POINT) and is structured in a modular, class-based design that makes it easy for AI agents to understand and modify.

### Context

As AI agents become more prevalent in development workflows, code needs to be written not just for human developers but also for AI comprehension and modification. Traditional code often lacks the context AI needs to make safe modifications.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional clean code only**
   - Pros: Familiar to developers, no extra markers
   - Cons: AI agents lack context for safe modifications

2. **External documentation**
   - Pros: Keeps code clean, detailed explanations
   - Cons: Documentation gets out of sync, AI must cross-reference

### Rationale

Inline AI markers provide immediate context where needed, making the code self-documenting for both humans and AI. The modular structure ensures changes can be made safely in isolated components.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- AI agents can safely modify code
- Self-documenting for new developers
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced chance of breaking changes

**Negative:**
- Slightly more verbose code
- Extra maintenance of PURPOSE tags
- May seem unusual to traditional developers

## 2025-07-25: Dark Theme Default

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Users

### Decision

All generated outputs use a professional dark theme with carefully chosen pastel accent colors. No light theme option is provided to maintain simplicity.

### Context

Modern developers spend hours looking at screens, and dark themes reduce eye strain. Additionally, dark themes have become the professional standard for developer tools.

### Rationale

A single, well-designed dark theme reduces complexity while providing a premium feel. The pastel accents on dark backgrounds create excellent contrast without being harsh.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Professional, modern appearance
- Reduced eye strain for users
- Consistent brand identity
- Simpler codebase (one theme)

**Negative:**
- Some users prefer light themes
- May not print well on paper
- Accessibility considerations for some users

## 2025-07-25: Symlink-Based Latest Tracking

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Users

### Decision

Use filesystem symlinks in a hidden `.maps` directory to track latest scans, with timestamped files in the outputs directory for history.

### Context

Users need quick access to their latest scans while maintaining a history. Various approaches were considered for tracking the "latest" scan.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Database tracking**
   - Pros: Rich querying, metadata storage
   - Cons: Adds dependency, complexity

2. **JSON manifest file**
   - Pros: Simple, portable
   - Cons: Can get out of sync, extra parsing

3. **Latest file copy**
   - Pros: No symlinks needed
   - Cons: Duplicates data, wastes space

### Rationale

Symlinks provide instant access to latest scans while preserving the full history. The `.maps` directory keeps the working directory clean while making latest scans discoverable.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero overhead for latest tracking
- Full history preserved
- Clean working directory
- Works with standard file tools

**Negative:**
- Symlinks may not work on all filesystems
- Hidden directory might confuse some users
- Requires filesystem permissions
